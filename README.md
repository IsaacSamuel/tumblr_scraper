#Web Scraper for Filtering Tumblr Blogs
Tumblr is a great blogging platform, but quizzically, it lacks a filtering feature for anything except archived posts. This application will take the URLS of one to several blogs, filters them based on content (including post type and length), and then outputs them to an HTML document. It's fast, dirty, and simple to use. Just run main.py and input your parameters.

Features:

-Filters based on post type, post length, and page limit.

-Uses requests module and the wonderfully easy web scraping module Beautiful Soup.

-First project developed using Test-Driven Development. (I read about it when I was developing my Flask project and thought it was a really clever idea.)

Utilizes Python, HTML, and CSS.
